    and produce a concise summary of the information. The summary must be 2-3 paragraphs.
    Capture the main points. Write succinctly, no need to have complete sentences or perfect
    grammar. This will be consumed by someone synthesizing a report, so it's vital you capture the
    essence and ignore any fluff. Do not include any additional commentary oterh than the summary itself.
"""

   - Consier potential challenges and how you'll address them
   - Explain your strategy for finding comprehensive information
   
2. Then generate 2 queries that:

   - Will help find relevant and diverse information
   
Always provide both your thinking process and the generated queries.
